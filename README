Decl-Tok

Decl::Tok is the first-line tokenizer for the Decl language; it takes a line iterator
(or a string that is turned into one) and returns a token stream iterator. Most parsing
is done at a later stage; the point of this tokenizer is to be as lightweight as possible to
allow indexing of codebases without a full parse.
